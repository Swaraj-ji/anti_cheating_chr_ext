## Backend
I
Backend folder consist of the backend code it simply takes the picture and send it to the firebase storage bucket. Inside the default storage bucket a folder is created whose name is same as of the email, which makes that folder unique for every user. User's pictures is being stored in the folder whose name is same as there email id inside the storage bucket.

This is the code to capture the picture and upload it to the firebase storage bucket.
